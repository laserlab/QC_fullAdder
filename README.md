# Implementing a full adder on a Quantum Computer (meaningful title here)

This serves as a homework template for CP1 2021 Homework3. Such a good idea!

## Introduction

You should include a short introduction what the project is about. Don't forget to include references/attribution to anything you read (documentation) or use(code) from somewhere else. Make sure you have the rights to do so as well.

## Setup

A detailed outline how to get you project running.

e.g.

1. You have to make an account on IBM qiskit
2. You should use Quantum Composer to do upload the Jupyter notebook from this repository to do this and that
3. ...
4. Press the run button to run it on a Quantum Computer, yeah!

## Results

Describe your results / outcome here.

e.g. I could count to three for the following cases:

1. 1+2=3

my code could not count to four for the following cases:

1. 1+1+1+1=3

## Discussion

Put in a discussion here.

e.g. My code could compute 1+2=3, however it took the QC 3 seconds and out of 1024 trials it did it wrong in 2% of the cases. So it might be not the best choice for this task. However, they are awesome for optimizing the [traveling salesman problem] (https://xkcd.com/285/).

## Outlook

Something you thought about but couldn't implement it.

e.g.

If I would do X and Y my implementation could even count to -3.
